# leet-game
A game made just because I got bored and had nothing else to do. I might update the game if this repository gets pull requests, etc. Also don't pretend that this is your application made from beginning.

+ The code its just a mess, not gonna clean it.

#### Looking/UI

# literalmente features 
+ Movable icons (these from the desktop)
+ Movable windows (Retard.exe)
+ Delete icons option
+ Show/Hide icons on the screen
+ Clock
+ BSoD when deleting This PC icon (not really working, not gonna fix by myself)

# How to build
+ The compilation should work fine using Visual Studio 2017 and maybe Visual Studio 2019, I doubt it will work with Visual Studio 2015, but if you have it, give it a try.
+ Building it as Release or/and Debug should be fine.
+ You should have installed .NET Framework 4.6.2 in order it to work/build!

# There are tons of bugs in this application that I'm not going to fix! Pull request a method to fix, or fix it yourself.
